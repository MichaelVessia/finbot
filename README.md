Finbot is a personal finance tool. Use it to manage your accounts, budget, and stock portfolio. Features include real-time stock tracking, transaction reports, and budgeting.


Finbot is written in the D programming language. It uses a SQLite database to keep track of all of your information so you can rest assured that your data will not be lost or corrupted. It is primarily a command-line tool, but there will soon be a web interface located at finbot.tech that can be used as an interface to the tool.
